Fraudulent Claim Detection
Global Insure wants to build a model to classify insurance claims as either fraudulent or legitimate 
based on historical claim details and customer profiles. By using features like claim amounts, 
customer profiles and claim types, the company aims to predict which claims are likely to be 
fraudulent before they are approved.
